# Kick_off

In Taiwan, we have a website called ithelp. It's a place where IT professionals from different areas can ask questions, give answers, and talk about various topics. I'm quite new to this field, but I've received a lot of help from this community. Inspired by ithelp's culture of sharing knowledge, I've decided to start sharing the methods and tools I'm learning about, but I'll be doing this elsewhere, not on ithelp.

My aim is to follow and spread the idea of helping each other and growing together that I've seen on ithelp. Since I'm still learning a lot, I want to approach this challenge with a humble attitude and a lot of hope for the future. I plan to share what I learn in a simple and useful way, hoping to help others just a little bit. By doing this, I hope to keep learning and sharing, and help create a friendly and supportive environment for all of us to improve. I'm just starting out, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me.
