# Kick_off

In Taiwan, we have a website called ithelp. It's a place where IT professionals from different areas can ask questions, give answers, and talk about various topics. I'm quite new to this field, but I've received a lot of help from this community. Inspired by ithelp's culture of sharing knowledge, I've decided to start sharing the methods and tools I'm learning about, but I'll be doing this elsewhere, not on ithelp.

The goal is to embrace and promote the spirit of mutual assistance and collective growth that defines ithelp. Acknowledging the journey of learning, the approach is to keep things modest and full of optimism for the future. It's about offering simple, practical insights that might serve to assist others, even in small ways. This effort aims at fostering a culture of ongoing learning and generosity, contributing to a welcoming and supportive space for everyone, and myself, to advance. As this new chapter begins, there's eagerness to explore the paths it will unveil.
