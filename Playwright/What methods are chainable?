Chainable Methods
 Locator Methods: Methods that return a `Locator` object can be chained with other `Locator` methods. These include methods to refine or filter locators, such as `.locator()` , `.nth()` ,`.first()` , `.last()` ,and `.filter()`. Because these methods return a new `Locator` object, we can contiune chaining with methods that operate on or further refine locators.


```javascript
// Chainable Locator methods
page.locator('.class').first().click();
```
